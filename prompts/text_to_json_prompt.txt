Format the provided input text provided below to JSON format, whereby the headers and other subheadings form the hierarchical keys of the JSON objects. Where there are multiple values for a key, ensure that the type of the value is a list containing the multiple values. Wrap the JSON in <json> tags. Create an additional high-level key named "CPT" with the value of the CPT code(s) and Requested procedure codes, if provided in the text, otherwise set its value to None. The CPT codes are typically either preceded by, but not limited to, the string "CPT code" or the name of a medical procedure or the string "Requested procedure". Ensure the `CPT` values are stored in a list. Do not output anything except for the extracted information. Do not add any clarifying information.
