Can you make a JSON schema based on the provided examples below that ensures all keys and nested keys, provided in the examples, are mandatory? You should infer and enforce the type for value to be expected from the provided examples, but enforce that values for the keys "condition met?" and "approve?" to be expected only as a single boolean value, and for the keys "evidence", "additional information required?" and "rationale" to be expected only as a single string value. I will be using the `jsonschema` package to validate this schema. Some keys in the examples maybe semantically identical but worded differently. Recognise these and produce new schema without redundancy. Please output the schema in JSON format. Do not output anything other than the JSON schema. Do not add any clarifying information. Wrap the JSON output in <json> tags.
